# The Art of Order

Game about order and chaos ⚖️

More info later!

## Setup

Before trying to build the game, you need to initialize development environment. In order to do that, run:

```bash
make init-workspace
```

It should create a Python virtual environment, that you can enter by typing:

```bash
source .env/bin/activate
```

Before you build the executables, you need to make sure the codestyle is correct; for that type:

```bash
make lint
```

It should run `black` linter that will fix any issues.
